This VSCode extension adds numbered `console.log`s between Javascript statements to help debug issues where a stack trace isn't available. A brute-force-but-effective away to track the path being taken within your code.

# To use
- Place this project within the `~/.vscode/extensions` folder.
- In the editor, select the code you'd like to fill with `console.log`s
- Press Cmd-Shift-P and search for 'Add Number Logs'
